At the moment, the owner chooses their favorite recipe from a selection and displays it on the home page. The company has noticed that traffic to the rest of the website goes up by as much as 40% if they pick a popular recipe. But they don’t know how to decide if a recipe will be popular. More traffic means more subscriptions, so this is really important to the company.<br/>
