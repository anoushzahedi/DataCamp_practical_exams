##Practical Exam: Tasty Bytes<br/>

Tasty Bytes was founded in 2020 in the midst of the Covid Pandemic. The world wanted inspiration, so we decided to provide it. We started life as a search engine for recipes, helping people to find ways to use up the limited supplies they had at home. Now, over two years on, we are a fully fledged business. For a monthly subscription, we will put together a full meal plan to ensure you and your family are getting a healthy, balanced diet, whatever your budget. Subscribe to our premium plan, and we will also deliver the ingredients to your door.<br/>
At the moment, the owner chooses their favorite recipe from a selection and displays it on the home page. The company has noticed that traffic to the rest of the website goes up by as much as 40% if they pick a popular recipe. But they don’t know how to decide if a recipe will be popular. More traffic means more subscriptions, so this is really important to the company.<br/>

We should:<br/>
1. Predict which recipes will lead to high traffic?<br/>
2. Correctly predict high traffic recipes 80% of the time?
